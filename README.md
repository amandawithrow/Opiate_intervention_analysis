# Opiate Overdoses and Intervention Effectiveness for Pennsylvania

## Background

Opiate addiction is a public health crisis across the country.  It is having an increasing impact on communities across the country regardless of sociodemographic characteristics etc.  As there is a focus on the epidemic, there is a correlating focus on interventions and their ability to reduce morbidity and mortality.

## Methods

We examined data from Pennyslvania, where we were able to get both state and county level data over time.  We looked at deaths resulting from overdose, sociodemographic factors (ex: age, gender, race) and the impact of three interventions they have implemented in recent years: naloxone administration by police and EMTs during emergency calls, boxes to surrender excess medication securely, and a support hotline to help individuals access care.

## Results

We saw higher overdoses in women and individuals 55 years or older.  Additionally, we found higher overdose rates in counties with smaller populations after controlling for population size.  With regards to interventions, we found no correlation between the drug boxes and overdose deaths.  There was a positive correlation between hotline calls and overdose deaths, pointing to the fact that the hotline is being used but perhaps not in the way intended.  

With the naloxone administration, we saw high rates, and high survival rates, with the peak being May to September 2018.  Survival rates were statistically significantly higher for those where they knew opiates were involved in the overdose, as opposed to non-opiate overdoses, or those where they did not know the drug(s) involved.  Even where opiates may not have been involved, survival was statistically significantly higher compared to circumstances where naloxone was not administered.  We also saw statistically significant differences across county administration rates, as well as over time, suggesting that there is some kind of reason or factor behind the trends, and that it is not due to simple chance.

## Recommendations for further study

Further investigation into the content of calls and access to care would help to understand the unusual trend of a positive correlation between hotline calls and overdose deaths. Additionally, digging into policy implementation dates, trainings and other context might help to better understand the trends surrounding timeline and county differences regarding naloxone administration.
